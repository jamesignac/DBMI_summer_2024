This summer (2024), I had the privelege of participating in research projects in the Shen Lab under Columbia University's Department of Biomedical Informatics. My research focused on the effects of gene variants on human fitness and understanding models that accurately determine the selection fitness metrics of a gene coding variant.

Attached are a written report of my research that I submitted at the end of my summer as well as code for the project. Below, I will also list the githubs to the models and papers that helped guide my analysis:
